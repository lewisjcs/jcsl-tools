# Grounding contract

Every claim a role emits — from any role in this Class, in any host,
against any artifact family this Class supports — must be grounded in the
artifact's post-change state. Three rules bind every role.

## 1. Post-change-state grounding

Ground each claim against what the change PRODUCES, not against a prior or
hypothetical state. Ground against the artifact as the change leaves it — the
state a reader or a downstream system actually encounters — never a state the
change removes, supersedes, or never reaches. A claim that is true only of the
prior state is not a defect in the change.

## 2. Confidence tracks grounding, not self-consistency

Confidence reflects how well a claim is grounded in the post-change artifact
— not how internally coherent the claim sounds. A self-consistent claim that
is grounded against the wrong artifact state (a prior state, an undeclared
state, content absent from the artifact, or an assumption unreachable from
this artifact) takes a confidence PENALTY, not a boost. Reserve high
confidence for claims verified against in-reach post-change evidence.

## 3. Tool discipline

The Class's protocol states how the artifact reaches a role — inline in the
dispatch or by reference to a bundle it reads. For all navigation beyond the
supplied artifact — finding definitions, callers, blast radius — use the `Grep`,
`Glob`, and `Read` capabilities: each returns bounded, repo-wide results in
one call. Reserve the `Bash` capability for `git`/`gh` operations and running
cited commands. One `Grep` call covers the whole tree; a shell
`grep`-then-`cat`-then-`sed` chain covers the same ground in far more calls.
If you reach roughly 15 navigation calls you are likely crawling rather than
reviewing — switch any remaining shell-based search to the `Grep`/`Glob`/
`Read` capabilities and emit findings from what you have.

## Evidence hierarchy

When grounding or disproving a claim, prefer stronger evidence classes over
weaker ones: execution (run the code path) over independent re-derivation
(recompute the claim from source without assuming it), re-derivation over
citation (quote the line that says it), citation over deliberation (argue
that it is plausible). Reach for the strongest class the artifact and your
tools allow before settling for a weaker one.

Agreement is not evidence. Any number of passes, roles, or models endorsing
the same claim raises no evidence class; only verification does.
